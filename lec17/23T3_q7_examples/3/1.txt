In this presentation, Stroustrup made a different claim than the designers of languages I've seen before,
he doesn't claim to purify everything with flames (OCaml), but rather, he is closer to the actual engineers
and practical project considerations, and starts from compatibility with the underlying language to find the
balance of his own system of rules, with unchanging fixed rules (mainly for the static analyses of achievable parts)
to deal with the challenges in a variety of real-world projects, and broadly compatible with the current underlying project
has been converted (Linux kernel proved this choice), through a set of limited rules he can achieve the security requirements
of his goals, and eliminate potential errors, has been able to save a lot of time and
management of modern projects, and in the premise of bringing the benefits of a painless transition as far as possible.
